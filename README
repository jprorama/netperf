A simple wrapper for bwctl to capture test run on demand.

Includes simplistic capture of data from the test and parameters
used to instigate test. The motivation is to support thoughput
tests in minimal install environments, where only iperf and bwctl
may be available.  The goal is to test campus and cluster fabric 
networks internally and to various external endpoints.

Includes some utilities to prepare the data for further 
consumption, e.g. Octave/Matlab.

More elaborate schemes should probably gravitate toward the
thoughput monitoring harnesses developed as part of the 
perfsonar toolkit.

This wrapper may eventually just interface with that library
framework.
